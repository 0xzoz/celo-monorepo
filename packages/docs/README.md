# Docs

Celo's main documenation has moved to [this Github repo](https://github.com/celo-org/docs).

This repository contains the autogenerated docs for the [CLI](../cli) and [SDK packages](../sdk).

## Celo CLI docs

Running `yarn docs` in the CLI package will put the autogenerated docs into the [command-line-interface dir](command-line-interface/).

## Celo SDK docs

Running `yarn docs` in each SDK package will create the typedoc generated documenation in the correspoding folder in the [sdk dir](sdk/).

The autogenerated docs are hosted at [https://celo-sdk-docs.readthedocs.io/](https://celo-sdk-docs.readthedocs.io/).
